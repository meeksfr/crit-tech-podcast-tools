good question and it's a hard question. I mean, you might say that the questions of legitimacy are core to the gender binary in some ways, right? In the way that masculine and feminine have been defined in Western culture for a long time now and how femininity tends to be associated with, for instance, passivity and emotionality. But within games, I think it's important to note that it was like a historical moment where these definitions of what a gamer is and what a game designer. There was a moment where it happened, right? It wasn't intrinsic from the very beginning of games history, right? If you look at, for instance, interactive fiction games, which were huge at a certain point in the history of games, there was lots of participation of women in particular and well-known women in there. But it was a moment, I think, of the professionalization of the video game industry where we saw a real commitment to a kind of sure-bet audience, that audience of the hardcore gamer, this typically young white male player that was seen as definitely going to be buying these games, definitely going to be investing lots of hours of them, definitely wanting to buy sequels and maintain a connection to a particular universe of games. And that goes with the kind of growth in profitability of the game's industry and an increasing risk of version within the game's industry. And we see the traces of that in endless cycles of FIFA and Call of Duty. And that's fine. Like I can understand why people enjoy playing those games, but it does suggest a sort of stagnation within the games industry that is counter to the possibilities of innovation, considering how many incredibly creative and talented people work there. It is in some ways about industrial norms. And that is very much connected to gender and the identity of who's the gamer and who's the person who's going to be making our games, because it was so invested in that one vision of the player for such a long time. And that configuration of the hardcore as being about particular investments in knowledge, in time, in difficulty, in certain kinds of language and spaces of culture that has made everything else that's happened. Alternative game spaces, alternative games, alternative game makers, alternative game players. There's more of that than there is the hardcore in many ways, but that investment in the hardcore is so longstanding in a risk-adverse place that it is really hard to shake. Everything becomes defined relative to that particular one place. And we must admit that there are very vocal people that use social media to harass all kinds of people, including people who work in the games industry, when these norms are seen as being somehow challenged or bypassed. So it's not just the industry being worried about their profit margin. It's also a sort of vocal sector of games culture that really perpetuates this really strongly, that contributed to things like harassment campaigns online and regular harassment campaigns against people who make games to this day. I can't imagine what it's like to work in the games industry. Individual people don't have a lot of say over what's legitimate in games. It's at the upper level that I think they're still resistance based on my interviews with people who work in the games industry. You hear a lot about organizations having women in games groups, or LGBT groups within the workplace. There's a lot of acceptance and a lot of interest in diversity, but they're fighting against the leadership, the management level, who have more of an interest maybe in financial questions. As a feminist and someone who's interested in political economy, you do spend a lot of time outlining structural issues, and they are powerful. And those are important things to keep in mind when we're talking about how to address issues of diversity inclusion. But I would say my answer is yes. There are ways to do this. And since Twine's Revolution was published, we do see shifts happening. It's just very slow as the issue. But even though there's that hard core hegemonic culture that does play a big role shaping what the industry priorities are, there are all of these other spaces. And like I said, they are actually larger than those smaller cultures and kind of industry priorities. So I do think that we're seeing shifts and more conversation in particular about diversity inclusion. And this is a good thing and a bad thing. Because like I said, I talk to people who work in the games industry, and they pretty much are all very much committed to equity, questions of inclusion. But the work that needs to be done, the actions that need to be taken, are not agreed. And you still find people, for instance, saying, I believe in inclusion, but merit is more important. These kinds of discourses, the leaky pipeline, there are ways of talking about this that can still create exclusion. And that's not done intentionally. So our problem is almost not people who are just outright sexist or misogynistic. Our problem is finding ways to shift culture that have been established for a long time and that kind of go against our common sense ways of thinking about what is talent, what are credentials, what do we need to do to get this project forward? We're in a lucky moment where people are more interested in these questions and more open to them. But it's about doing the work with community members and of different kinds of groups and trying to figure out how do we action that? How do we change our common sense way of thinking and doing things that can accommodate diversity and inclusion? Because if you just look at it from quantitative standpoint, getting more women in, then we're just going to continue to have these issues of, yeah, but the women are then underpaid, the women are jobs are more likely to be automated and outsourced, the women are going to be leaving after a very short amount of time because there's problems with retention. So we do have to think about those more difficult questions of like culture and context to really increase diversity and inclusion because it's not about increasing as much as it is about kind of diffusion in all spaces. Not just asking about getting in, but about staying in and about achieving and progressing and getting to the highest levels of management, for instance. So, something that we should all think about, I think, is these questions of inclusion and diversity, right? Any time that we're looking at what's going on, that has to be part of the politics, I think. We can't unsee now. We know how important it is. Almost every problem that we see when we're talking about, for instance, AI or big data or any of these things, there is an issue to do with who's working in those sectors and how they design for the world and what they understand to be harm and vulnerability that is deeply informed by their own subject positions. So it's important to ask who's there and how are they being included or not included. Another thing I would suggest as important is to be really critical when we're talking about digital technology about what are positioned as solutions to things. That's why I started looking at women and games groups because a lot of people are like, that'll be great. All those women will learn how to make games and then they'll go into the industry, the industry will be more diverse, Bing-Bing-Bing-BOOM. And it's like, of course, you have to be like, what's going on there? What is its relationship to the industry? Is that even their goal to increase the number of people who are working at EA or Ubisoft? And I think looking at solutions is really important. That's something I'm working on next. I have an insight grant that I'm working with Dr. Tamara Shepard on mentorship schemes because this is something I've seen in a lot of places. Like we know that there's issues in our sector, so that's okay though, because we have a mentorship scheme and that will help support women in their professional development and career progress. So I think it's really good to look at like, at the end of a piece where we've talked about the problems and we're like, but here are some things that might be promising to follow that as kind of a breadcrumb trail to your next research project. Another thing I think is often overlooked maybe because we work in education sectors, most of us ourselves as researchers is that educational spaces are a really important part of the asomblage of digital technology. They're not innocent, neutral spaces. They're at a confluence of many different kinds of pressures in terms of funding, in terms of policy, in terms of internal and institutional discourses around recruitment of students for instance. And so I think it's important for us to, even if it seems a bit navel, gazey to look at educational contexts and the role that they play in the culture of digital technology that surrounds us.\n"]}],"source":["import whisper\n","\n","model = whisper.load_model(\"base\")\n","result = model.transcribe(\"/content/s3e5p3.mp3\")\n","print(result[\"text\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#open text file\n","text_file = open(\"/content/transcript.txt\", \"w\")\n","\n","#write string to file\n","text_file.write(result[\"text\"])\n","\n","#close file\n","text_file.close()"],"metadata":{"id":"SZr1KMpaMObd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693951063807,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":294,"user":{"displayName":"Mika Sustar","userId":"06861688082833689175"}}},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["a = 10"],"metadata":{"id":"oh8643A8T06y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693950371710,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":259,"user":{"displayName":"Mika Sustar","userId":"06861688082833689175"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(a)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FZATnm1oT3Wq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693950567033,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":250,"user":{"displayName":"Mika Sustar","userId":"06861688082833689175"}},"outputId":"e81aed21-378a-4297-9261-92826d4f1467"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["10\n"]}]}]}
