But what we found pretty quickly was that that term was a little bit restrictive in terms of what he wants to look at, and also easy to give a singular definition to.\n","And we found really much broader. Why the field of discourse, if you like, in which terms and ideas and concepts and means and images for kind of blowing around, we use the term reactionary digital politics to really capture a quite a broad range of different clinical positions and locations and individuals that runs on the one hand\n","from seemingly some people, moderate figures like Jordan Peterson, prominent Canadian Former Psychology, Professor, 2 explicitly all right.\n","Now it's not because we say they share in common as an approach and attitude to politics is also found among offline political movements.\n","The so called Payo Conservatives and Christian Nationalists.\n","For example, in Europe, all right generation identity, but also more specifically online kinds of formations and defined on posting board for channel, for example, that you' find and it's a quick, all right, different individuals, and posters producing comments on Youtube, but That's poor Josie watson from the\n","Uk to the manufacturers from Canada.\n","Whole range of different kinds of people, and what we don't want to dismiss the differences between these people, we can think it's helpful to think about them as part of a larger continue to lie united by sharing certain kinds of orientations.\n","And attitudes towards politics, and trying to understand that being promoted in mainstream, conservative politics to very extreme major politics, what we found was that you could think of them as connected and being reactionary in the sense of resisting progressive movements with resisting in general historical development principles of democracy\n","and equality, and that also helps signal a continuity between contemporary online reactionary politics and the kind of classical reactionary politics that might associate with initially resistance to the financial revolution, the spread of democratic participation and so on I don't know if it's worth\n","adding with it, it's not been entirely uncontroversial.\n","Once, we talk to other scholars working in this area, some feel like reactionary.\n","Has this balance the kind of denies how radical some of these individuals and groups are, but for the reasons Allen outlined in your decided that it did the work economically in terms of the issues that we see most important and I think another important thing to ask a lot of these groups is\n","that even if they don't share ideas and ideologies, or if they do, or if they have contribradictory, you know self contradictting ideologies even within certain formations, they share a certain political style and tactics and orientation, to politics it's often conceived\n","of as in the phrase, Alex. Jones, you know some kind of info war.\n","There's a battle between asset. Describe an idea that they rational political groups in your study all seem to frequently refer to what does natural order mean in this context?\n","So in a way, we're using some natural in a political sense, kind of scientific or any other consent.\n","It's really a way of thinking about what politics is and what politics can do.\n","What the entry wants to do is to hope to stop it from happening the way to do that is to insist that there are certain things you can't do because it's not and the emphasis really in use of that is on blocking some stopping it from happening rather than\n","making a systematic case about more than limited, of our natural conditionals.\n","So it's very different, for example, from saying.\n","On the rules of physics. It's written a way of saying there's a hidden underlying order.\n","Everything must be able to conform to because, of course, the raps we're talking about nature.\n","Understand that people are doing these advanced nature we're great, and then wants to call us back for it, and that might be justified by appeals too.\n","That experience claims about so called evolutionary psychology.\n","For example, but more often I think the implication is a kind of mystical hidden board.\n","That's just distributed people to the right places in society.\n","Some above, some below, some of certain old, and others with other different kinds of roles, and that we mustn't depart from that, and hopefully throughout the and they really want to return to something that is given by define revelation.\n","And others who are not so committed, to publish whether they just can still use client saying this course as a way of preventing certain change, or justify status quo Christianing, to say when someone says, the wire, some people really rich. And some people not at all to say Oh, wow! It's just natural it's because they're better they what they\n","worked. They have more cloud ideas. That's what it's happening, and contribute the outcome to nature rather than trying to explain and understand how much of a process is my work.\n","I would just add that when you see these claims to the natural order sort of in the wild, and you see these groups making these claims, they also appeal to either God, as you were saying, Allen, some kind of a mystical order ordained by God, or to a really oversimplified and\n","misleading conception of genetics, and how it shapes our lives, since it's often like to evolutionary technology and sort of the way evolution is shaped.\n","Our capacities, but in entirely misleading ways. Yeah, in some sense, is the right.\n","There's a desire to seem like the rational ones.\n","The ones who are obeying the dictates of science.\n","But but also not see that signs the whole idea of the alpha male, which is discredited.\n","The whole idea of racist pseudoscience, eugenics also discredited, but part of the rhetorical arsenal that makes things sound science. See, when you're talking about wanting to roll back progress, Allen in your article neoliberalism the alt right and the intellectual\n","darkness. You use the term ideological, entrepreneurs to describe some of the conservative digital content creators driving a lot of this round.\n","What are ideological entrepreneurs. And why is this a useful framework for understanding contemporary politics?\n","So the concept of or term of mind is trying to do a number of things at once.\n","Really, on the one hand, the emphasis on the work, ideological so trying to stress the people we're interested in people.\n","We're looking at characteristical online reaction, critical phenomena.\n","Isn't they? They don't just offer a position or a take on particular issues.\n","They're offering something a much broader way of thinking about how politics and society and economy work with analyzing it.\n","But the viewers, followers, and support us, can take on board in apply to particular cases themselves.\n","The one ideological is important. There, but they're also doing that in a way that's different.\n","From how that's happened before is the intellectual function for the company has long been understood and longer around.\n","But we're talking about online ideological entrepreneurs are they're not tied specifically to political parties.\n","They may be connected to them, but they're not members that are governed or organized or reprimanded by the restricted by the demands of those parties.\n","They're also journalists of sort. They're not members of journalistic profession or news institutions that might exercise some kind of governance over what they do and shape quantum and not allowed to. Nor are they whether they may be parts of universities.\n","They're also not govern, strictly speaking, by the rules and procedures of the Academy.\n","So you have people who are 3 of those were codes and rules of conduct for intellectual public activity.\n","More than they do instead. Well, they're also on digital platforms which are commercial platforms that are funded by advertising or by subscription.\n","That may sell merchandise alongside that and that could be quite an important part of their revenue.\n","But that's important, because if I can't maintain that separation from traditional civic political institutions, but also it gives us an incentive to respond to your audience and try to build your audience, generate more revenue and generate more success, there is a different sort of incentive I\n","would argue to what is present, perhaps in multiple traditional, political intellectuals, and it can mean that if they're accountable at all, then Idl entrepreneurs are accountable to the bottom line to the audiences, they have a very immediate relationship with and that may intensify the ways in\n","which they seek to combine, that into their politics. So that is necessary to say they're just instrumental I think there is a lot of instrument that's important part of it. But there's a new way in which the instrumental self interest the ideal of just the intellectual\n","role. How? That's doubling, and relates to public political life.\n","That's a different assembly that produces different kinds of this courses and different kinds of Rob Gallagher.\n","I know you have something to add here. I think maybe another term that's that's helpful.\n","Here, and I believe it's on the second. This coined, or certainly what she says is alternative influences, and in a sense, what's going on on a lot of these channels and platforms not dissimilar to people building a brand around their makeup tutorials.\n","They kind of influence the marketing techniques that have come out of the monetization of platforms like issue, all being used to sell people on a politics, or even even more on a kind of vision of self-improvement.\n","But one that's rooted. It's more in these kinds of ideologies than it is self-care or getting better at using cosmetics or whatever it might have been that's an excellent point, that part of being able to connect them to a whole other world of online\n","speakers and communicators in kind of end diagram shows how part what's happening is a politics is becoming in some respects a little less like politics, a little bit more like a certain kind of commercial self-help, as Rob says, entertainment kind of media and that's just absolutely fundamentally\n","important you want to understand what's happening in the article and in the podcast and in your answers here today to emphasize that this is actually about a range of political ideologies, including conservatism nationalism, libertarianism.\n","Fascism, and many others converging, or at least youiting against perceived common enemy, which you call the new class.\n","Allen. What is the new class? And how is this idea mobilized by reactionary political groups and their followers?\n","So any political movement is gonna mean posit, some kind of external agency to which it's supposed, and the case of reaction to your politics.\n","That is, as you say, the new class I think it's important to think about that.\n","To understand what that is, because that's also where in which we try and locate this phenomenon within real historical social training, people think about how they understand that.\n","But the real social change. So a clear sociological, economic, phenomenon of the post war period 1,945, particularly since 1970, S.\n","Is the massive in the number of people working in white collar, technical, cultural, managerial kinds of employment in large corporations, but also particularly in stable public sector employment.\n","And that's true. Of course you is also true in United States as it is in Canada, and particularly recently.\n","That's also been intensified by the expansion of people involved in Comms communication, advertising, and human relations.\n","So on, that's fundamental change. For example, and change the experiences of power and control.\n","In workplaces. Send me a at the moment, I would perhaps blamingly. So there's no such thing as industrial relations, and whether we are having a way that strikes problems at work and result from human resources as well so that's very much change economic and occupational experience at the same time there's also been\n","a huge expansion in the number of people who work in the cultural sector, advertising comments. I've already mentioned that there's more broadly media and different areas of design and so forth.\n","And that really changes people's experience on something of culture.\n","As culture becomes primarily commercially produced and disseminating.\n","So what you have is emergency. Different kinds of groups that are exercising different kinds of social power, which can you can experience very directly more.\n","Might experience, the power, all billionaires or the shareholders of large corporations.\n","Because we're seeing the TV products, we're seeing the advertising.\n","We're reading the thing. The doctor says that the Government says we should do we are surrounded by that much more often.\n","What rat traditional politics does is give that all of that very diverse range of activities, a single net, the cultural meet in the administrative state, liberal media.\n","And so they give them a series of names, but then unify them, and then also characterize them as being driven by concerns that are peculiar to them.\n","Anti-racism, equality, politics, gender politics, and tries to make those concerns seem as if they belong just to those kinds of people and not to everybody else.\n","The ordinary working class, where they might characterize it I don't know, that for assigned to that class is somewhat documented, actually, they're doing all these things for some other reason, that we're not quite being told about is part of an agenda.\n","That's part of our strategy to underline traditional values, traditional communities, the nations so on and so forth.\n","And then they begin to talk about how they look like what they sound like.\n","Or they're speaking some way and have some taste. Identify them.\n","They're obviously all going for. And then they begin to talk about how they look like what they sound like, what they're speaking some way and have some taste ident and that way the new class can become a name that shapes an attack on all kinds of public activities governmental or non governmental public activity in a way to all kinds\n","of collective action all of which can be dismissed as the just, the expression in the particular view of this class that is trying to tell us what to do of course, that's also a way I'm not talking about very very large important kinds of economic power.\n","Rob team I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n","I think maybe one thing to pick up on that is a number of people working in something.\n","Like Communications, advertising, marketing, and the way those roles have a connection.\n","Not that everyone wants to. Those positions is universally educated, but a lot of people have gone through university system.\n","So it makes the University a point of emphasis, and also what Hr.\n","Is doing, appointed that this is, as Alan said in industrial relations happens a lot through Hr.\n","And there's a sort of tricky political question around the commitment of large corporations to anti-racism or to diversity initiatives.\n","So I think a lot of times we're people are critiquing reactionary digital politics for responding to it, especially within the mainstream liberal discourse that the response to these reactionary groups is to say, okay, they're reacting it identity politics.\n","They're reacting against political correctness. They're reacting.\n","It against? Okay? So maybe part of the problem is, these things have gone too far.\n","And that misses that really what this one is about growing that democracy inequality, it's not really about critiquing.\n","That is just a means to the end of undermining democracy itself.\n","But the tricky bit is that a lot of people do experience things like diversity initiatives through Hr.\n","Has recently written a book called The Lead Capture, which is about this particular.\n","Ist, from the left, from an anti-racist perspective that a lot of people are experiencing sort of diversity, initiatives in this really kind of hollowed out Hr discpor.\n","And then they're also seeing it happen through corporation, saying, You know we support black lives, matter or tweeting out something in a supportive pride.\n","So the sort of reaction in response to that is to look.\n","They're all in on it, and they're all trying to control you.\n","And then there's a mistake that's often made to say, well, actually, what's happening here is these groups are connecting with people, because, you know, there is something like white working class person in the provinces who doesn't like this stuff.\n","And they kind of missed but the actionary politics is really about, and then they also miss the actual function of the new class what are those semic tab will cost a week.\n","Captioning is where large corporations take on diversity discourse and use it basically for Pr and marketing purposes.\n","And then, because so many people work in pr marketing, advertising, communications, there's a way that diversity initiative becomes collapsed with corporate columns.\n","And then the reactionary groups can take advantage of that and call it a plot right and what's missed is that this is a kind of holiday, and also that these reactionary groups are actually concerned with rolling back to market inequality itself, and rob Gallagher\n","you've mentioned that tech companies also play a role. I guess digital tech companies themselves figure in this in quite complex way.\n","And on the one hand, there's this idea that they imported this kind of Californian Silicon Valley Liberalism, which, like, don't necessarily.\n","And there are controversies about the kinds of content they want, and or employees like James Daniel doing all the concerts on over his comments about female engineers, but, on the other hand, obviously these platforms are seen as offering a voice to this notion of voice to this\n","populist mass. So there's some. They kind of figure, both as an example of this kind of new class to some extent, but also a potential solution depending on how people are branding it part of what we're trying to get it in his hands is that the new class is it and\n","it has some of those effects, so want to do with the inequality in the Uk.\n","But, Mister Michael, go during the Brexit withdrawal from the new campaign, when we declared that people have had enough of an experts which has been widely annoying.\n","But of course, at the same time lots of people will encounter certain kinds of experts coming in, telling them how to do that, and household how to interfere in that community state, wherever it might be.\n","I'm good. How things are for people on the street.\n","That is a real phenomenon, and one that was, of course, identified a long time ago by critical theorists and and that's a list of different kinds that's somehow that's clicked over and become used by the right is a way of justifying and as rob says, and as\n","both I'm very systematic and much larger scale, not just on the distribution of cultural power.\n","Our own substantive claim to, a crucial contribution of this project is the finding that although the figures and various ideologies involved do diverge in some way, they share a common belief in human inequality, or anti-equality, can you please speak a little more about this I take the view as\n","a political doorist, but one of the the essence of conservative is not commitment ultimately to tradition.\n","But there's a commitment commitment to imports that's part of what it exists, and it partly exists to resist move towards the quality as they happen to be at a particular time.\n","So how in quality is resistance, and how inequality is justified changes of time, and also changes when depending on the kind of but it's sufficiently broad in terms of the concept I think, to help unite the very diverse range of reactionary political formations that we've already been been\n","talking about. So I think what we can wait to understand this diverse range is presumably it's united around a common commitment inequality, and as well said earlier, a commitment to an idea that there is some kind of natural order, so natural hierarchy that is being improperly and dangerously\n","disrupted for the intervention. So the State, the new class, so that might be an in the distinction between sexes, or it might be that action quality, as I listed to we have been relations between races.\n","But it might also this is quite important, it be the inequality in that is revealed naturally for free, unrestricted market competition, and which ones, talents or competencies can be truly revealed in that true price.\n","So for the range of information, anyone that cuts across that natural expression or tries to bypass it or suppress it remember, that is but quality or market regulation at some time is a deep level kind of aense against nature and it's gonna be disastrous.\n","It's gonna be chaotic, and is by definition unjust to this position cannot otherwise complete you.\n","Deeply questioned traditionalist payload conservatives.\n","On the one hand, to libertarians we want no restrictions and regulations at all.\n","10 year. Liberals, who are mostly concerned about the ways in which markets function, but they can be united this way, basic level of saying, there's a natural order to things.\n","And when we allow that natural order which we might think of as being God's plan for evolution plans, some of them do.\n","Once we mail that to express it so everything will be fine, and the reason why I think it's gone wrong because someone's been messing around with that that could almost them be an explanation of individuals as to why they're not successful in this society that's told them they should be successful.\n","Everyone is free to participate, because it's not me.\n","I am truly one of the great people in the world, but it's because the market competition has been linked through other people by the Liberals with their hiring policies, and they're diversity practices and so on.\n","They made it really hard for me, and that's why it's all it's not what I'm changing to do with.\n","Yes, I think it's worth linking this back to.\n","I ideological entrepreneur, because this view of the naturally unequal and a marketplace of competition creates an opening.\n","For ideological entrepreneurs, both for those who can identify the way that market has been hindered or undermined or prompted by class or you know, mainstream Liberals, but also for those in ideological entrepreneurs who can offer a version of self help as robin was\n","talking about, is, there is a lot of concern in these groups.\n","Yeah, it's particularly online with finding a way of maximizing months potential through diet to exercise.\n","On pickup artist scripts which are oops primarily of young men who want to pick up women.\n","They talk a lot about looks, maxing. So it's about eating right? Going to the gym.\n","Sometimes plastic surgery, although not you. Mostly. It's not diet and exercise, so is there this sense of oneself as a dialogue with certain capacities that allow one to compete on this marketplace for for jobs, for sex, for clout and then the need to\n","maximize, one capacity, and that's what ideologic log entrepreneurs help people do.\n","That's what they're offering. Yeah, how do you approve yourself in this marketplace?\n","Which is not to say that self help is inevitably reactionary.\n","But there's not a lot of tension between interactionary worldwide and self-published course.\n","They tend to have one another, and this also, of course, surprise to the competition for attention on digital platforms with all their metrics and their subscribe accounts that are accusations of virtue, sigling or stolen manner or credence, politics, a friend in terms, of that this is people cheating\n","to get attention online. And it's skewed playing field, giving air time to ideas.\n","That don't have any substance, and these are only really cynical attempts to game.\n","These digital systems. So again, the degree to which the digital platforms are just the vehicle.\n","For this they encode this logic. That's been reflected in the way that people approach politics.\n","Some of the stand around, place within. In your article, Allen, you argue that the intertextual nature of digital technologies and genres enables different ideas and isms.\n","To quote, flow across forms and forums picked up by individuals plotting their own path to them.\n","End, quote? What role does this intertextuality or flow play in the spread, or even mainstreaming of reactionary political ideology?\n","So there! I'm trying to get it again. A number of things.\n","One of the main to do with the Circle barriers to entry into political discussion.\n","So, Bill, let's talk about how the Internet reduces the barriers.\n","Entering of anyone can set themselves up as a and I'd like to go into panel, and we can start running.\n","But also there was a barriers to entering for individuals just looking to find out about politics.\n","30 years ago, if I wanted to go to find that about typically.\n","But I might have to go across town in a meeting sitting room.\n","No, make money into that literature, and then I wanted to go to another one.\n","I had to. Man. I hope I can move between all of these different legal tendencies in a client.\n","There's no graph. So that begins then to break down some barriers between biological discourses and movements, and begins to create a kind of flow of different ideas in terms between them.\n","So then, what will be going to happen then? Is it? What moves around is fragments of a political discourse it might be means of images.\n","It might be the names like new class or culture, or liberal conspiracy, whatever it might be.\n","Essence can flow and move around. In ways that I wanna quite meet.\n","The individual is searching the Internet but also in that having certain kinds of qualities and taking shape. And on the one hand, that could mean that someone might pick up an idea or turn or phrase, or move with no idea when it's come from lots of people will share a minimal line with no idea that it was invented\n","by crazy people. That's a technical term. One doesn't necessarily know that it came from the far right or wherever it came from.\n","Yeah, one level, because it has broken free. It's original context.\n","So maybe we don't worry so much about it. On the other hand, it means that when you are drawing on that little thinking, or in your own discussions or communication with other people, your friends and Facebook, you are bringing a little bit of a discount in that may be brings things with it that you weren't\n","entirely aware of. And, conversely, somebody else on the Internet might say that thing you shared.\n","The soundception, and not realized that they, into a different kind of political space, bringing them into contact with all kinds of other sorts of ideas, I may not even see as being particularly extreme.\n","I think one might understand how natural context works in terms of the movement of these kinds of fragments.\n","These kinds of needs, as opposed to whole systems of, I think they do call quotations and the example, I always think, called this just the time cultural marks isn't, which begins way back for the Internet as as a large anti Semitic conspiracy theory in which somehow I don't know when the framework is\n","responsible for the sexual revolution and lots of other things, but then spreads through forms like and other places in the Internet as a name.\n","For then for the for the people in the strings, all the social, cultural changes that have that have happened over the last 15 years.\n","And certainly in the in the number 9 comments in online newspapers, in the magazines.\n","So posters there saying, Oh, yes, this is about the cultural access. This is what's happening on that side.\n","Hello! Above the line of people in quite common respect for, and now in the Uk, it's been using these features of people who are being covered by Foreign Secretary suggest that those who are using that phrase or and here's the way I can smell an anti smoking conspiracy.\n","But it's moved across the Internet from the bottom of the Internet and up intimation, little discourse.\n","It brings things with it, and it also can be away, and would be drawn into.\n","I'm complaining about food code, and they just features.\n","If somehow food was responsible for everything from the country. So what that's about is different ways in which ideas and fragments flowing.\n","It's a question as to what they've been living in, what I happen.\n","This technology design of, say, the algorithm that determines the contents of your social media feed also play a role.\n","In these processes from Gallagher brought to Pinka your thoughts thing here as well, although the role of the algorithm has made it been overstated in this, in it's sometimes a way kind of be politicizing.\n","This as if people don't have any agency, and what they seeking out, and why?\n","Obviously these systems that exist to kind of organize and return, content to searches who are doing their own research pick up on the fact that certain times and some figures are related, and that this might be the sort of thing and this sort of person's looking for so it's not all driven by these\n","individuals, just kind of chew races over, patching together.\n","And it's that also informs how the systems that everyone's understands the bones.\n","I think that links to what I was saying earlier.\n","Defining what reactionary politics is and what it's about.\n","And it's about an information war. So there's an effort to sometimes fight explicitly. Game.\n","Game, the system, I game, the algorithm team search results so that when people search for certain terms they'll get certain results.\n","And also so that people will attach certain meetings to certain terms.\n","So one word that comes to mind where I am is broke.\n","This, and sort of a moral paddock around wellness.\n","This is a term that sort of enter the mainstream British discourse over the last year or 2, and it's had a strange career right?\n","Because woke is a term that originates. Come on, black Americans for a way of remaining alive to the oppression. One space.\n","It's on a daily basis. And it was spread particularly by Erica.\n","In 22 it came out to saying about staying well, and that's what it became a phrase that people would use.\n","It was popular by Twitter and then it sort of made the lead to the Uk, not from like Twitter, but from reactionary groups responding to it and critiquing it and saying, Well, wokeness is now the official discourse that everyone is will compulsory.\n","Well, this the universities are enforcing the corporations are enforcing.\n","So this is an example of the reactionary right winning in a war.\n","And I think a lot of people in the Uk are kind of waiting, and in a way, at this point in the Uk.\n","And at least it's become so detached from its origins that it doesn't matter what its origins are, because the reactionary right is sort of one control at some sense over that term. They've shifted.\n","It's context, and it means something different and is connected to a different kind of policy.\n","And that can happen very quickly.
